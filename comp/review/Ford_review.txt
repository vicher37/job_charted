Working with the Firm Ford, Cooper and Kako fast paced agency maintainging confidential files and records.
The work environment is good, the work is interesting, and every day I learn something new on the job. Would highly recommend a position at Ford Motor Company.
Friendly and conducive work environment. Big company - Opportunities to grow and develop Dress down Fridays in-house restaurant Free parking
good place to learn; friendly management; challenging job; good perks; helping to co-workers;the most enjoyable part of the job
It could be a matter of my management but there is no job training/education.  It is talked about how much Ford supports it and in my experience no classes or conferences are approved.
Great, Great company with Great leaders, Supervisors and co workers. Was hired in without College degree and was there 17 years until it became obvious with Buyouts that they were looking for the creme of the crop when auto business hit its low spot in 2007. I took the buyout and really appreciated the opportunity.
Ford offers a competitive salary. It's a great place to work if you like selling cars because the atmosphere is all about that. Great cars sell themselves.
From Previous work places, work ethics, timeliness, organization, you work for any company its to achieve the companies goals to make a successful future for all.
Ford was interesting, high strung , long hours, worked second shift, doing the same thing over and over and over again was mundane,  mandatory overtime, I  had opportunities to advance after a year.
produced car parts, spent 10 great yrs with Ford Motor Co this is a great company to work for would highly recommend, co-workers were great.
Ford is an overall good company. The people are great, employee involvement is encouraged and you are part of a team.  Youcan use your brain every day and be a part of the solution to problems.
As an intern on the new Certified Pre-Owned business, I'm sure my experience was different of most. That being said, I had a fantastic manager and I learned a lot about the manufacturer/dealer relationship.
Assembled parts with power tools, worked well with team and supervisors. Packed quality parts for shipment. Changed machine fixtures.
this job was only seasonal I was the person they would hire in the summer when employees wouldn't show up for work. It was only Mondays and Fridays wish they would have hired in full time
I enjoyed working for Ford Motor Company, however had a better opportunity. It was a great experience working there. Working for the automotive companies are a great opportunity.
Assembly line work is hard work. I truly love customer service. Assembly work pays well, but as i said before it's hard work.
Great bosses and co-workers, driven and motivated environment, and overall relaxed but productive atmosphere. Definitely would recommend this company to others.
great company with great benefits and coworkers, job very demanding and fast paced at times. Overall great place to work
The pay is good the benefits are decent, how ever as a salary employee on the manufacturing side you work 12+ hour days, and you are compensated, but you do not have a set work schedule and can be called in to work weekends last second. Work life balance is bad, plus you are forced to use vacation when they want you to.
I was a contractor and it was a great company to work for. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management. I learned how to code DB2 STORED PROCEDURES on this assignment.
I was busy from the beginning of the day to the end. I learned to be a good statistical typist. Some of my management were great to work for and my coworkers and I got a long very well. Hardest part of my job wasn't at work, it was working and being a single parent. I enjoyed my job. I work well under pressure for deadlines
